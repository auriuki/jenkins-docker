It's strongly said to run Jenkins in Docker!!! **Don't even try run Jenkins on Windows!!!**

## Simple docker file for jenkins with docker inside
Dockerfile for Jenkins with Docker inside

### About
I was planning to run many application like python projects 
and other in Docker on Jenkins using Jenkinsfiles to automate delivery.
I did not expect that I face so many issued only 
because I decided to run Jenkins on Windows instead Linux.

The last problem overflowing bitterness was problem with using dockers.

As solution I found *jenkins-withdocker* docker image, but it was still not perfect.
This docker images are not up to date when you use global docker repository 
(it have to be rebuild every time when Jenkins releases new version). 
It cause requirement to manual plugin installation 
and solving problems with plugins security after jenkins version upgrade, etc.

#### Reason
I created this repository to be able setup docker in the future 
with simple steps described in this README.

##### Why Jenkins on windows in docker?
Jenkins on Windows have problems with: 
- running Jenkinsfiles  (error like: [Error response from daemon: the working directory ... is invalid, it needs to be an absolute path.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48390638/11318366))
- [wsl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is not fully supported (problems with paths, tools visibility/execution) 
- [dockers](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50857) are not supported on windows (there are many other tickets)

I spent too much time on solving integration between windows, wsl and docker, configuration, etc. so I decided to move Jenkins to linux using Dockers.

#### Solution
The best solution turned out to be use Docker image with Jenkins with Docker inside as it is suggested in official Jenkins documentation, so don't event try run Jenkins on Wondows without doceker! 
Well you can use it without docker only for simple tasks. 


Therefore, as the solution I this README to guide you how to setup easily working Jenkins on Windows.

# Installation
## Docker on Windows
### Requirements:
- CPU Virtualization enabled (read below)
- Create account on docker.com (required to start docker - it allows to publish private docker image to repository - not needed but account is required)

### Instruction and detail: 
[Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

#### In short steps:
1. Download docker installer [Docker Desktop Installer.exe](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe)
2. Follow the install wizard
3. Click Finish
4. Run application and login

#### CPU Virtualization
In order to run docker CPU Virtualization must be enabled. You can enable it in BIOS.
Check if virtualization [is enabled](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)

## Build docker image and run
- Checkout this repository or copy Dockerfile to any location
- Open Command Prompt (Win+R, typ cmd)
- Go to place with Dockerfile

- Find build docker container
$ docker container ls
```
```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                              NAMES
2535364c7a3e        3f56b90c6bb8        "/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:50000->50000/tcp   jenkins
```
- Copy docker *CONTAINER ID* 
- Run docker. E.g.
```cmd
docker run ^
  -u root ^
  --rm ^
  -d ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -p 50000:50000 ^
  -v "E:/Docker/Jenkins":/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  --name jenkins ^
  jenkinsci/blueocean
```


### Running created container
```bash
$ docker container start jenkins
```

### Removing container and image
###### Stop container
Stop container before removing. 
```bash
$ docker container stop jenkins
```
###### Remove container
Stopping and removing container is required to be able rebuild docker (container)
```bash
$ docker container rm jenkins
```
###### Remove image
```bash
$ docker image rm jenkins
``` 

## Jenkins configuration
Open web browser and type address `localhost:8080` and follow instruction: [Unlocking Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#unlocking-jenkins).<br/> 

The `/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword` file is located under mounted place. e.g. in my case it is `D:/Jenkins_docker/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
(`/var/jenkins_home` is "mapped" to `D:/Jenkins_docker`)

I suggest install without any plugins (select None) and add it later.
